for text formatting:

after created all locales, make sure to search for and replace

&nbsp; ===> \u00A0
&mdash; ===> (—)
&ndash; ===> (–)
&laquo; ===> («)
&raquo; ===> (»)
&copy; ===> (©)
&quot; ===> \u0022 (")
&apos; ===> \u0027 (’)
&cent; ===> \u00A2 (¢)
&pound; ===> \u00A3 (£)
&yen; ===> \u00A5 (¥)
&euro; ===> \u20AC (€)
&reg; ===> \u00AE (®)
&hellip; ===> \u2026 (…)
&rsquo; ===> (’)
&lsquo; ===> (‘)
will come up with better solution later on, but for now - stick with it. i'm too lazy to create a component that works with Trans (i18n)
