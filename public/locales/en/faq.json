		{
			"question": "Is complex installation required?",
			"answer": "No. If you already have cameras/microphones - we'll connect Gideone in minutes. Without existing equipment, we provide a complete turnkey solution."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if employees object to cameras?",
			"answer": "In 9 out of 10 cases, staff perceive Gideone as an assistant, not surveillance. The system doesn't punish but teaches: new hires adapt faster, experienced employees earn bonuses for high ratings."
		},
		{
			"question": "How soon will I see results?",
			"answer": "First changes appear in 3-5 days: employees start mentioning promotions more often. Average ticket growth comes in weeks 2-3."
		},
		{
			"question": "How does Gideone integrate with existing training?",
			"answer": "The system complements training - reinforces knowledge in practice and identifies development areas."
		},
		{
			"question": "What about privacy?",
			"answer": "We use encryption, store audio-video temporarily - only text analytics remain in reports. All data protection requirements are strictly followed."
		},
		{
			"question": "How can I verify it actually works?",
			"answer": "Typically in the first month, average ticket increases by 10-15%. We also reduce control and coaching costs, while dashboards show all statistics."
		},
		{
			"question": "Can scripts and rules be modified later?",
			"answer": "Absolutely. Make changes via web interface, and the system instantly adapts to new phrases and standards."
